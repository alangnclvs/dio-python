A Python-based simulator for essential banking actions including deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. The program comes in three versions: a basic version, a plus version, and an oriented-objects version.

### Basic Version

- Deposit funds into your account
- Withdraw funds from your account
- Display your current account balance

### Plus Version

- All features from the Basic Version
- Create new user accounts
- Create new bank accounts for users
- List all existing bank accounts

### OOP Version

- Implemented using object-oriented programming principles

# Database Integration Project: SQLAlchemy and Pymongo

This project is part of the Digital Innovation One (DIO) course, where the goal is to implement both a Relational Database with SQLAlchemy and a NoSQL Database with Pymongo. The project focuses on integrating SQLite using SQLAlchemy for a relational model and MongoDB for a NoSQL model.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1 - Implementing a Relational Database with SQLAlchemy

In this part, you'll implement an application that integrates with SQLite based on a provided relational schema. The goal is to create classes representing tables in the relational database within the application.

#### Objective:

- Application with schema definition using SQLAlchemy classes.
- Insertion of a minimal dataset for information manipulation.
- Execution of data retrieval methods via SQLAlchemy.

### Part 2 - Implementing a NoSQL Database with Pymongo

In this part, you'll implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB to provide an aggregated view of the relational model. The existing client and account information will be contained within documents according to the client.

#### Objectives:

- Connect to MongoDB Atlas and create a database.
- Define a collection 'bank' to create client documents.
- Insert documents with the mentioned structure.
- Write instructions for information retrieval based on key-value pairs.

These projects were created as learning exercises for the Digital Innovation One Python Developer challenge.
